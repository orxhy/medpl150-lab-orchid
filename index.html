<p>Born and raised in New York City and I am currently a general media studies major. I enjoy discovering new music through different genres like EDM or techno that help me find different DJ's that inspire me. I am not too experienced with a lot of tech that involves cameras or different softwares, I am more than excited to learn about them. Messing around with a beginners DJ controller is really fun especially when it comes to mixing different tracks. I'm looking forward to engaging in the different types of media that I'll come across since I'm unfamiliar with the different kinds of visual art and videography that goes into a lot of film.</p>
