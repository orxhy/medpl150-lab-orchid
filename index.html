<li>Homework #1</li>
<p>Born and raised in New York City and I am currently a general media studies major. I enjoy discovering new music through different genres like bass house or techno that help me discover different DJ's that inspire me. I am not too experienced with a lot of tech that involves cameras or different softwares, but I am more than excited to learn about them. Messing around with a beginners DJ controller is really fun especially when it comes to mixing different tracks and learning how to overlay one on top of the other. I'm looking forward to engaging in the different types of media that I'll come across since I'm unfamiliar with the different kinds of visual art and videography that goes into a lot of films. Music has played a significant role in my life and due to how prominent it still is, Iâ€™m interested to see how my knowledge of the different kinds of sound can help to further my career in the media world. Expanding my knowledge on certain audios, the types of shots filmmakers will use to convey certain emotions, or even the types of software and materials needed to make a short film; they are all integral to my learning journey towards my media studies degree. Though I am still learning about the basics of media, I enjoy finding interesting sounds or peculiar images that can make any video interesting as well as capturing interesting objects that jump out at me in my everyday life.</p>
