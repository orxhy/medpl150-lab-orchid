   <p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
  For my second collage I wanted to focus on air pollution and its effects on different ecosystems and the environment. I used a picture of smoke, underwater animals, grass, and some birds. I ended up having it divided into three parts with the grass on the bottom, water in the middle, and the smoke all up in the air. For this one I utilized some blending modes and then used the gradient feature for most of the masks on my layers. I found it cool that I was able to get the smoke to overlap with the underwater portion of my collage because I feel like that really shows the effects wildfire smokes have on our atmosphere and for water animals.
