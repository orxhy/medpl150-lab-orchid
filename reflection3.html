    <p>I decided to read Kadiatu’s story <i>The Devil at My Door</i>, which tells the story of a mother from Sierra Leone who had lost her children to Malaria because she lacked the proper healthcare to treat her children. I enjoyed the comic style of the story because it made it more engaging. It helped me to have a deeper understanding of the kind of person she is, and created a stronger sense of empathy that would not have fully translated from reading a long wordy article about her situation. The illustrations and text provided an immersive story that captured her emotions, thoughts, and actions. Having these tools to tell a story was very impactful to the way I felt when reading because it allowed me to step into her world and her circumstances. I could feel her helplessness and confusion when trying to figure out what was happening to her children as well as the ostracization she felt going through this on her own. Kadiatu’s own community feared what she was going through, as they didn’t understand why her children had passed and believed it was some sort of possession or the work of a witch. In smaller and rural villages like Sierra Leone most individuals living in poverty turn to traditional healers, while in bigger cities that have access to hospitals will most often go to the doctor in times of need. The photograph shown towards the end of Kadiatu’s children was a very heartwarming surprise because like any story, I tend to hope for the main characters happy ending; so seeing the smiling faces of her healthy children was comforting knowing they were able to get the treatment they deserved. The video of Doctor Nellie explaining the simple treatment that Kadiatu could have received from the beginning if it was readily available to her made me realize that countless people have lost their lives to curable illnesses. Visually, the illustrations vary from the photograph by portraying a sense of realism that wouldn’t have been possible without a photograph. Seeing the photo of her children after reading the graphic novel gives you a moment to remember that these are real people who are going through terrifying circumstances. It creates a compelling contrast linking a digestible story to a very real photograph of the children who had to go through painful conditions. Though poverty is an issue that isn’t unfamiliar to many—including myself—having read this in the form of a comic was a very intriguing experience that I believe is very creative. This form of storytelling has the ability to bridge the gap between reality and fiction in what may seem like a lighthearted read, but in reality it is thought provoking and fosters a deeper emotional understanding for readers. It can be very easy to view the number of people living below the poverty line as a statistic and brush it off, but with this approach it allows you to come face to face with the people who are struggling.</p>
