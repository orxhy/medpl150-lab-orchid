<h1>Reflection 1</h1>
<p>The overall theme I gathered from In Plato's Cave of Susan Sontag’s excerpt was her views on photography and its functions; they can act as evidence of reality but at the same time, it also changes our realities. The way Sontag goes about the whole idea of photography and how it can reimagine our societies was interesting because she holds photography to a very high standard but then harshly, critiques it. The complex reality of photographs is something Sontag emphasizes, especially after its industrialization. Though it is beneficial to things like memories and evidence to prove one's innocence(or guilt), on the flip side it can also be harmful and immoral when things like masturbation material or pornagraphic images are shared and used. The concept she brings up about ‘knowledge’ and its relation to still photos was compelling in the sense that we can’t completely rely on photography as a form of knowledge. Sure there are bits and pieces of knowledge, wisdom, and empathy we can gain from analyzing certain pictures; however, Sontag uses the word ‘semblance’ when referring to the knowledge we can gain from them which I found to be intriguing. It is not factual or logical information that we are learning, rather it is a tiny fraction of everything we know and see in the world around us. It is whatever has been characterized for us by an individual or team of individuals of a certain picture that can set in place an individual's understanding of the photo. Politics often go hand-in-hand with propaganda especially when it comes to genocides and wars in other countries, where the US is heavily involved. She brought up the pictures shared of the Vietnam and Korean war and the side effects it had on public opinion in the US. We understand these wars to be different when in reality both wars were, in retrospect, a genocide and deserved to be shown for what was truly happening. It prompted me to think about different historical events and how I grew up viewing them, but further insight and research done on my part led me to relearn these events for how they were holistically. Not only is education a crucial opportunity for people to understand history in its true form, the way we are taught history plays an impactful role in how we view things today. It’s solely up to the viewer how they choose to pick apart a photograph and try to understand the artists, editors, or photographers meaning behind it, however it also is important to keep in mind the biases we all hold even if we may believe that our opinion is unbiased. Having that mentality is important to the way we can grow and learn from every aspect of our lives. In the same sense, a picture may also be deceiving with the things it contains while also leaving out key aspects. We view things never as they are, but only how we have been socialized to see them.</p>
