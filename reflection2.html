    <p>Author Nesrine Malik shares her opinion on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in her article With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster. Malik explains how mainstream AI has become in content shared on all media sites, yet its impact and value is questionable and controversial. She goes into howAI-generated photos and videos, otherwise known as "AI slop," have become more prevalent online, blurring the lines between fact and fiction. In turn, this is making it more difficult for users to distinguish between the two. These pictures, which range from innocent imaginative settings to political propaganda, are frequently used to spread false information or push a specific agenda. In my own work, it is difficult sometimes to find images that may or may not be AI. With the collage assignment, I was able to gather non AI-generated images in my piece that would illustrate my overall message. Though it is in a sort of political theme that I ended up gravitating towards, it wasn’t difficult to see which images in my research were AI-generated. Especially with themes related to the US president, it was evident which images were meant to portray a specific narrative, but understanding the intent behind it was confusing. Seeing the prevalence of these images when finding photographs for my collage helped me understand the kind of ‘AI slop’ author Nesrine Malik voiced. These pictures are very overwhelming and oftentimes have insane imagery that makes you take a closer look. Inspecting these images is always interesting especially when it is so obviously portraying a certain message. I came across some images and videos shared by the US president on his X/Twitter account that are blatantly AI-generated which was really fascinating. Donald Trump is sharing these videos that are heavily biased to support his own motives and it may not seem harmful to those who know it’s AI, but it does make you think; if someone comes across these posts on Trump’s account especially those who support him, it has the potential to make people take politics in a less serious manner. The actions Trump has recently taken have been coming into effect very evidently, but going onto Trump’s Twitter account after seeing everything is shocking. His team has curated dozens of AI-generated videos and images to make him look better, take jabs at political parties/rivals, or just super obviously fake videos shared as a ‘meme.’ The kind of imagery shared on this twitter account feels so out of touch with the effects of Trump’s presidency. It was not within my research to choose an image through his account, but it did show me just how much AI content is being utilized on the internet. Though it may not look significant, it does have a vital role in overwhelming and ‘desensitizing’ individuals who are seeing the constant barrage of AI-generated content. To make silly and quirky jokes to mock other political parties but to uplift yourself using AI feels very immature and disrespectful as a President.</p>
